# FinalProject

# Overview
BrainStorm Bubble is a real time mind mapping app where teams can brainstorm together on a shared canvas. You can create idea bubbles, connect them with lines, and move things around and when one person makes a change, everyone else sees it happen instantly. It's basically Google Docs but for visual brainstorming.
